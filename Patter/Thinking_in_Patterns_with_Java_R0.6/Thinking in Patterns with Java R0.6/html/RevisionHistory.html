<h4>Revision 0.6, August 23, 2001</h4>
<ul>
<li>Completely re-designed "Chain of Responsibility" example
<li>Added new State Machine Framework and Vending Machine Example
<li>Added Decorator "coffee" example
<li>Added Jikes support to makefiles
<li>Added "Preface" and "Introduction" material
<li>Added "Design Principles" in Introduction
</ul>

<h4>Revision 0.5a, December 8, 2000</h4>
<UL>
<li>Cleaned up the enumeration type in c11:PaperScissorsRock.java
<li>Made a number of user-suggested corrections
<li>Modified JPython section to reflect the change to Jython
</ul>

<h4>Revision 0.5, September 30, 2000</h4>
<UL>

<li>Did a lot of work on the makefile generation tool (written in Python, not 
yet available), including the addition of new types of comment directives, such 
as =M, +M, =T and +D. These are described in Chapter 9 where they are used to 
automatically created the makefiles that have more sophisticated dependencies. 
Some small rewriting was done in that chapter to accomodate this.

<li>Added a small amount in the Iterators chapter: the beginnings of a type-safe iterator.
<li>Added Jeremy Meyer's rats & mazes code to Chapter 13 (Just a quick add; no rewriting)
<li>Converted most tests to black-box tests
<li>Other small code modifications to improve design/implementation
</UL>

<h4>Revision 0.4, August 8, 2000</h4>
<UL>

<li>Added <I>Interpreter</I> chapter, which focuses on the use of <b>JPython</b> 
as the Interpreter pattern, with a fairly thorough exploration of 
<b>JPython</b>.

<li>Added "White-box & Black-box testing" section and examples to the test 
chapter. Modified <b>RunUnitTests.java</b> so that it supports both black- and 
white-box testing.

<li>Added placeholder chapter for <I>Iterator</I>, with brief overview of what I plan to do.

<li>Created discussion group for book at <a 
href="http://www.topica.com/lists/TIPatterns">Topica</a>

<li>Changed download so that it is combined book & code

<li>Added page linked off of the head of each chapter that describes how to build the code

<li>Changed makefiles to use GNU make, which is free at <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">www.gnu.org</a>. See the page 
linked to the top of each chapter with the title <i>Build the Code</i> for more 
details.

</UL>

<h4>Revision 0.3, May 2000</h4>
<UL>
<li>Added Unit Testing chapter 
<li>Modified all code in book to use unit tests
<li>Modified Python code extraction tool to add unit testing to makefiles, so the unit
    tests are executed automatically as part of a <b>make</b>
<li>Modified <b>TrashVisitor</b> to use <b>VisitorDecorator</b> approach
<li>Redistributed exercises, added one or two new ones (taken from the seminar)
</UL>
